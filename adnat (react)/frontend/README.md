# A few notes from me
Firstly, I would like to point out that I am a backend developer looking to branch out to a full stack role. This is really the second time I have touched react.
I wanted to do way more on this. I wanted to implement all endpoints and style accordingly. However, I am working full time and applying for other jobs. This has lead to me burning out and I am out of fuel. I do understand a lot of what I implemented and found it quite challenging and enjoyable to learn. 

- This is my second time using react.
- In total, including learning time, I would estimate I spent about 10 hours on this. There were a few gotchas that stumped me for a while like CORS on chrome and callbacks. But after that it was pretty smooth sailing. 
- There is no Get organisation by Id route. I have added an extra leave organistaion button because this became an issue with testing. 
- At this stage (12:46am), I can't get semantic-ui to install, it keeps freezing when trying to create a theme.config. I am capable of doing CSS myself, but in this instance, I don't have the time.
